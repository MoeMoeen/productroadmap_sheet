# A New Way to Build Roadmaps

### From Prioritization to Portfolio Optimization

Most companies today still build roadmaps the same way they did a decade ago:
lists of initiatives, subjective scoring, and negotiation-driven prioritization.

What we are building replaces that model entirely.

We are building an **optimization-driven roadmapping platform** — a system that continuously selects the *best possible combination of initiatives* that maximizes the company’s North Star metric, while respecting real-world constraints like engineering capacity, market commitments, strategic mandates, and operational reality.

This is not a ranking tool.
This is a **decision engine**.

---

## The Starting Point: A Living, Central Backlog

At the foundation of the platform is a **central initiative backlog** that aggregates:

* small and large initiatives,
* from all markets, countries, departments, and teams,
* continuously synced from intake sources (sheets, tools, requests, ideas).

Each initiative is enriched with:

* multiple prioritization scores (RICE, WSJF, custom math models),
* an explicit business and financial impact model,
* engineering capacity estimates,
* ownership by market and department,
* and clear linkage to company KPIs and the North Star metric.

This backlog is not static.
It is **always-on**, always evolving, and always ready to be optimized.

---

## The Core Shift: From “Best Initiatives” to “Best Portfolio”

The critical insight behind this platform is simple but profound:

> The best roadmap is not the set of the highest-scoring initiatives —
> it is the **best combination of initiatives**.

Individual initiatives do not exist in isolation.
They compete for the same engineering capacity, influence overlapping metrics, create synergies, introduce dependencies, and serve different strategic obligations across the company.

So instead of asking *“Which initiatives should we do?”*,
the platform asks:

**“Which portfolio of initiatives should we execute together to maximize our outcomes?”**

---

## Optimization as the Decision Core

At the heart of the platform sits a formal **optimization engine**.

This engine can use:

* linear programming,
* mixed-integer optimization,
* or non-linear optimization techniques,

to select the optimal subset of initiatives from the backlog.

### Objective Function

The system optimizes for:

* the company’s **North Star metric**, or
* a weighted combination of strategic KPIs defined by leadership.

Targets are treated as **minimum thresholds**, not ceilings.
Exceeding them is explicitly rewarded.

---

## The Primary Constraint: Engineering Capacity

The most critical constraint in reality — and in the model — is **engineering capacity**.

We model capacity as **finite engineering tokens**:

* each initiative consumes a quantified number of tokens,
* total consumption cannot exceed available capacity per period.

This abstraction makes trade-offs explicit and measurable.

It also enables powerful conversations:

* MVP vs full-scope versions,
* reducing cost while preserving value,
* increasing ROI to improve selection probability.

The roadmap stops being emotional — it becomes mathematical.

---

## Fairness, Balance, and Strategic Coverage

Optimization does not mean centralization at the expense of fairness.

The system supports **structural constraints**, such as:

* minimum engineering allocation per market or department,
* maximum caps to prevent over-concentration.

This ensures:

* no market is starved,
* no department dominates disproportionately,
* the roadmap reflects both global strategy and local needs.

---

## Targets as Floors — and Gaps as Signals

Markets and departments often have **explicit targets** tied to the North Star metric.

The optimization engine ensures that:

* these targets are met at minimum where feasible.

If the optimal portfolio **fails to meet targets**, the platform does not hide it — it surfaces it.

A gap becomes:

* a visible signal,
* a strategic alarm,
* and a trigger for structured collaboration.

Either:

* better initiatives are needed,
* initiatives must be redesigned,
* targets must be revisited,
* or cross-market collaboration is required.

The roadmap becomes a **living negotiation grounded in data**, not opinion.

---

## Every Initiative Has a Causal Metric Chain

Each initiative must define:

1. **Immediate KPI**
   A metric the initiative directly and almost fully controls.

2. **Primary KPI / North Star Contribution**
   The ultimate business metric it contributes to indirectly.

3. **A Quantified Metric Chain**
   A clear theoretical and mathematical linkage from:
   immediate metric → intermediary metrics → primary KPI → North Star.

This chain:

* informs the business and financial model,
* enables transparent comparison across initiatives,
* and allows LLMs or PMs to generate or validate models consistently.

Nothing is hand-wavy.
Everything is traceable.

---

## Standalone, Dependent, and Synergistic Initiatives

Not all initiatives are independent.

The platform explicitly models:

* standalone initiatives,
* prerequisites,
* co-dependent initiatives,
* and synergistic bundles where combined value exceeds the sum of parts.

The optimization engine supports constraints such as:

* “all-or-nothing” selection,
* prerequisite enforcement,
* mandatory co-delivery.

This prevents:

* half-built systems,
* broken value chains,
* and false optimization.

---

## Enablers, Programs, and Leadership Mandates

Some initiatives are **non-negotiable**:

* platform foundations,
* cross-company enablers,
* leadership-mandated priorities.

The platform supports “always-included” constraints, while still:

* computing their cost,
* modeling their impact,
* and transparently showing opportunity cost.

Leadership decisions are respected — but never opaque.

---

## Scenario Planning & Real-Time Trade-Offs

Reality does not wait for quarterly planning cycles.

Urgencies arise.
Opportunities appear.
Priorities change mid-quarter.

The platform enables:

* real-time what-if scenarios,
* rapid portfolio re-optimization,
* clear visibility into trade-offs.

If we add something, **something else must go** — and the system shows exactly what, why, and with what consequence.

This is structured, defensible “horse trading,” powered by math instead of politics.

---

## Initiative Scoping as a Strategic Lever

Because cost is explicit, scoping becomes strategic.

Product and engineering teams can:

* test lighter versions,
* adjust scope,
* reduce capacity consumption,
* and improve ROI.

Better scoping directly increases the chance an initiative enters the optimal portfolio.

---

## Category-Based Portfolio Balance

Initiatives are classified into categories, including:

* UX/UI enhancements
* New features and capabilities
* New value propositions
* Bug fixing
* Hygiene and baseline quality
* Infrastructure and technical foundations
* Observability, BI, and monitoring
* Innovation (when applicable)

The optimization engine supports **floors and caps per category**, ensuring:

* hygiene is never neglected,
* infrastructure is never postponed indefinitely,
* innovation does not cannibalize fundamentals,
* and the roadmap remains resilient and balanced.

---

## The Result: A Continuous Strategic System

This platform is not a planning tool.
It is a **continuous strategic operating system** for product organizations.

It:

* aligns local initiatives with global strategy,
* replaces opinion with transparency,
* turns disagreement into structured collaboration,
* and transforms roadmaps from static artifacts into adaptive portfolios.

Most importantly, it gives leadership, product, engineering, and markets a **shared language** — grounded in value, constraints, and outcomes.

That is the future of roadmapping.
